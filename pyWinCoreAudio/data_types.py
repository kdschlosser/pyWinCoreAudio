# the following code is something I will usually avoid
# but seeing as how there are so many enumerations I figured
# what the hell.
# This code is alot of smoke and mirrors or as I call it "voodoo magic code"
# The enumarations are used quite often as return values to identify various
# parts and pieces of a sound device and endpoints and I wanted a mchanism to be
# able to attach a description to the integer values contained within
# the enumerations. One of the nice things the developers over at Microsoft
# did was they gave pretty good names top the enumeration values and I thought
# if I could use those value names or portions of them as the descriptions
# that would save me quite a bit of time having to hard code all of those
# descriptions. Well the code  below is the result of that effort and it works!
# well mostly. I did give myself a way to also hard code the descriptions to
# handle the oddities that occur.

# I created a wraper around the `int` class that allows me to pass 2 arguments to the
# constructor. the first argument is the integer and the second is the description string.
# In python 2 this was easily accomplished by creating the wrapper and overriding the
# __init__ method and calling super and only passing the integer to it. This cannot be
# done in python 3 because the value does not get set in the __init__ method. It gets
# set somewhere else, I have not been able to locate where. To fix that issue I created
# a metaclass which sits in the middle. It intercepts the call to the __init__ method
# and then create the class only passing the ineteger and set the description after the
# instance has been created.
class EnumValueMeta(type):

    def __call__(cls, value, description):
        instance = super(EnumValueMeta, cls).__call__(value)
        instance.description = description

        return instance


# this is the int wrapper class, I only overrided the __init__
# for keeping an IDE happy with passing the description.
# I overrided the __str__ method so it can be used as a label or printed
# and it will return the description.
class ENUM_VALUE(int, metaclass=EnumValueMeta):
    description = None

    def __init__(self, *_, **__):
        super(ENUM_VALUE, self).__init__()

    def __str__(self):
        if self.description is None:
            return int.__str__(self)

        return self.description


# this is the voodoo magic part. The metaclass __init__ gets called when the class gets built
# what is passed to the __init__ is the name of the class, bases (parent classes) and a dictonary
# with the class attributes set in it. I am not able to place anything directly into the dictonary
# nor can I create the class and then set anything in the classes dictonary. I can however use setattr
# to set what I need to. I parse the class name and build a prefix if the prefix is found in the
# begining of the attribute name I strip it off. Then I parse whatever is left over of the attribute
# name to add spaces where they need to be added. place those into my fancy ENUM_VALUE class and attach
# that instance to the attribute name using setattr.
